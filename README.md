# 📖 iHireAnywhere<a name="about-project"></a>

**Aircrafts** is a web application that allows users to browse and source for Aircraft specifications  from various manufacturers . It uses React for the front-end, Redux for the state management, and Axios for fetching data from an external API. The application consists of three main components: craftDetails, craftDis, and Navigation. craftis displays a list of available aircrafts with their specification. craftDetails shows more information about a selected aircraft, such as the manufacturer's name ,engine description, speed etc. Navigation provides a header with the current year and the text of the current page. Users can navigate between the pages using buttons with arrow icons.
